          Duck-billed platypuses are small, shy animals with a flattened head
          and body to help them glide through the water.

        <p id="info">
          The duck-billed platypus's head and body grow to about 15 inches and
          its tail grows to about 5 inches long. They have an amazing snout that
          looks like a duck's bill, but is actually quite soft and covered with
          thousands of receptors that help the platypus detect prey. Platypuses
          spend most of their time alone, sleeping or eating.
